## Setting Up

1. You will need an approved SSO client ID with Recess. Reach out to [mingjie@recess.gg](mailto:mingjie@recess.gg) to get one.
2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local` and fill in the values. To test against our production system, you do not need to change the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SSO_BASE_URL` value.
